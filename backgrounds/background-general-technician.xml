            <p>You've made it to General Technician after a few years, and all it might have cost you was your GPA, friends, and sleep.  You've got the job down by now and can do it all pretty quickly.</p>
            <p><i>I didn't become a Tech to gaff cable or lift JBLs-that's the PA's job.  If you need me, I'll be in the booth.</i></p>

			<p class="indent">As an action, you can command a willing, friendly creature to take a single action.
            The action cannot involve moving more than 5 feet, unless you command them to only take movement; in which case the creature can move up to half its speed.
            If the creature successfully completes their action, you may add 1d4 to the result of one of your future rolls.
            This does not stack with subsequent successful actions i.e. you cannot stock up on additional d4 using this feature to add to a roll.</p>
