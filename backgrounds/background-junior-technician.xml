            <p>You've been around for a while.  Maybe one year, maybe four or five.  You've learned a lot, but not enough to get on enough jobs.  Tough luck.  Maybe you can find time in shop or on fantasy hockey jobs.</p>
            <p><i>You've worked so many hockey jobs and have perfected your spotlight aim, but there just aren't enough opportunities to shine. Eager to act, you gain an extra attack when you need it. The gains you made lifting those heavy spotlights grant you extra strength in your times of need.</i></p>
