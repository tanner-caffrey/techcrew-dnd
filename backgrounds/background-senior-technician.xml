			<p class="indent">As an action, you are able to explain a technical concept to any creature that can hear and understand you, choosing to either confuse or teach:
            <ul>
                <li>If teaching, the next time the creature makes a skill check, ability check, or saving through, they add your ability modifier to their result. If you have proficiency in the check or saving throw, also add your proficiency or expertise bonus to their result.</li>
                <li>If confusing, the creature must make a (DC 12) Wisdom saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature becomes confused and has disadvantage on its next attack or saving throw.</li>
            </ul>
            You may only attempt this action on each creature once a day.
