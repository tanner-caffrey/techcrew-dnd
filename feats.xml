			<p>You've never studied for sign offs, it took you five tries to pass your PA-12 sign off, and you only got the customer service sign off because you guessed the coordinator's number correctly with random numbers.  Honestly you don't know how you've made it this far, but you haven't gotten in trouble yet. Gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain proficiency in the Deception skill.  If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.</li>
				<li><p>You have one luck point. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.</p>
                <p>You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker’s roll or yours.</p>
                <p>If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.</p>
                <p>You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.</p></li>
            </ul>
